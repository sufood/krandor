### Plot Hook
* City/Town is attacked by kobold raiders during the night [Side-plot – PCs Defend the Inn]
* The kobold attackers were eventually driven off
* One band of kobolds was cornered and has retreated to and holed up in the local sewers
* Community leaders (Inn keeper?) approach the PCs to help hunt down and capture the kobolds for questioning.  [Side-plot - Hunt the Kobold's to their Lair]

### Decrepit Sewers
#### Lore
Lore DC 15 - Quite old and probably in need of repair, be careful.

Lore DC 20 - Collapsed in many places in this area, really lots of stand-alone sewers.

Lore DC 25 - The local mages have been known to augment the sewers during particularly poor periods of sanitation with magical oozes.

#### Conditions
The sewers are knee deep in foul water.  All terrain is considered difficult.  Any movement above 1 square per turn will cause ripples detectable with a DC 12 passive perception within 5 squares.  Any creature falling unconscious immediately begins to drown.
Make good use of darkness, ripples in the water, echoes, perceived vulnerabilities, poor footing, difficult movement in water in heavy armour.

#### Details
##### Entry - Area 1 & 2
What a wonderful new smell you've discovered!  We don't go right – not since the accident... careful or the rats might hear you... any noise and the kobolds in area 4 will be alerted.

Potentially... 3 x Giant or Dire Rats (MM 219).  (mix it up depending on the challenge you want)

##### Eye Spy - Area 3
Kobold Dragonshield allows himself to be seen then falls back.  Other kobolds remain hidden and delay their actions until a PC rounds the corner near where the '4' is marked on the map.  Then they ambush!

##### Surprise - Area 4
When a PC rounds the corner hear they should get attacked by 4 kobold minions and a Kobold Wyrmpriest spell.  (The Kobold Dragonshield attacks last, then shifts away to defend the Wyrmpriest)

1 x Kobold Wyrmpriest (MM 168) - alive: 300XP, dead: 150XP

1 x Kobold Dragonshield (MM 168) - alive: 250XP, dead: 125XP

4 x Kobold Minions (MM 167) - alive: 50XP each, dead: 25XP

Remember to make use of the 'Shifty' power of the kobolds, especially given the movement restrictions.

##### Watch your Step - Area 5
10 foot drop into sewer cistern.  Resident ooze, an Ochre Jelly (MM 202), takes umbrage.  PCs can fight or flee.  The ooze cannot pursue beyond the 10 ft drop-off.  The ooze eats everything, no treasure.
