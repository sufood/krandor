### Conditions
Make good use of darkness, echoes, the perceived vulnerabilities of crawl spaces and climbing with inappropriate weapons and swimming in water in heavy armour.  Field running guerilla combats, ambushes and traps.  Think of the fear of being in someone else's element, and they know it.

### Details
#### Secret Entry (Behind Waterfall, who would guess?) - Area 1 
The first place the PC should look, Easy DC 15 climb to enter

#### Secret, Secret Entry (and lookout) - Area 2

#### A River in the Cliff - Area 20
No resistance, powerful river current upstream, only feasible exits 21, 11 and back to 1

#### Teleport Altar - Area 21
Wyrm priest teleports out via altar on sight.  There is no way for the PCs to operate the mysterious altar

#### Teleport Altar - Area 4
Kobolds can teleport from this altar to area 21 and back, to help flank invaders

#### Swim-Through Tunnel - Area 11 (DC 10 Swim check)

#### Mushroom Garden Cavern - Area 10 (Boat to area 12)

#### Giant Mushroom - Area 9
