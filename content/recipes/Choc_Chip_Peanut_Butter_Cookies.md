1. Slowly beat in the dry mixture
1. Reduce mixer to slowest speed and add the choloate chips
1. Continue manually folding in chocolate until well combined
1. Chill the dough in a refrigerator for a couple of hours (optional, but this is what makes it chewy!)
1. Use a level #20 ice cream scoop to scoop even cookies onto cooking trays, you should get 6 to a sheet
1. Bake in oven for 14 minutes or until golden brown (checking cookies after each 5 minutes and rotating sheets for even browning)
