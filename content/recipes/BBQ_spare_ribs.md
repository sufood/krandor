### Ingredients

+ 1.5 kg 'American style' spare ribs (2 racks worth)

### Marinade                

+ 1 Small jar of red currant jelly
+ 2 crushed and chopped garlic cloves
+ 1 Tbsp finely grated ginger
+ 1 tsp paprika
+ 1/2 tsp red chilli flakes
+ 2 Tbsp soy sauce
+ 1/4 cup red wine vinegar
+ 1 tsp salt and pepper

### Method

1. Mix all the marinade ingredients together well
1. Heat the marinade gently over a low heat until the jelly dissolves
1. Allow marinade to cool
1. Place ribs in a large oven proof dish
1. Pour over marinade
1. Work the marinade into the ribs with your hands
1. Cover the ribs with cling film so there is no air gap
1. Refridgerate overnight (or for at least 1-2 hours if short on time)
1. Remove the cling film
1. With a sharp knife, deeply score the tendonous inside of the spares ribs between each bone (this will help the BBQ heat break down the tissue between the bones)
1. Work the marinade into the score marks with your hands
1. (Optional step) For best results cover the spare ribs with foil and bake them in a a preheated oven at 160 degrees celcius for 2 hours
1. Sear the spare ribs for about 5 minutes on each side over a medium BBQ heat (**reserve the marinade for basting**)
1. Reduce the BBQ to LOW and cook gently, covered if possible, for 1 to 1 and 1/2 hours turning every 10 minutes
1. If the ribs look to be burning, turn and baste them with the reserved marinade
1. Remove the ribs from the BBQ, cover with foil and allow to rest for 5-10 minutes
1. Meanwhile, reduce any remaining marinade over a low to medium heat for 5-10 minutes
1. Remove the foil from the ribs, cut between the ribs between the bone
1. Toss the ribs in the reduced marinade, and plate to serve

Note: Goes well with a vinegar based coleslaw and diced apple
