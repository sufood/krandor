### Description

Moroccan spiced chicken thighs on cous cous. (serves 2)
Chermoula is generally used as a marinade for Moroccan fish dishes. You can add tomatoes to the chermoula paste to make it more like a salsa. Some chermoula recipes use a mild vinegar instead of the olive oil (whimps!).Â  Fresh coriander and fresh garlic can be used but then again you could also grind your own cumin (where does the madness stop? Actually, freshly grinding everything is very nice, try the madness sometime)
